validation rules:

- validate that one player only made one move for any round
    - right now we'll need to run get_links for that, can we avoid it?
    - alternative: get agent activity
        retrieves source chain headers from this agent
        get all headers that are get_link / new entry for game move
        validate that we're not repeating the same move

        validate that moves are made with timestamp >= game session
    - another alternative: avoid strict validation here, instead take first move
        made by agent for any round and use it when calculating
        - NOTE: we'll have vulnerability
        - NOTE: update round closing rules to check that every AGENT made a move

        - TODO: impl validation to make sure move is commited by player who's playing the game

// would actually be a game session entry) and attempt to close the current round by creating it's entry.
// This would solely depend on the amount of moves retrieved being equal to the amount of players in the game
